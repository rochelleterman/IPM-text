### Overview

This course introduces students to modern quantitative text analysis techniques, with the ultimate goal of providing the skills necessary to apply the methods in their own research. We will use the open source programming language `R`. Demonstration corpora are provided. 

### Prerequisites

Students must have basic computer skills, must be familiar with their computer’s file system, and must be comfortable entering commands in a command line environment. 

The workshop will also assume basic knowledge of the R programming language.Students are strongly encourged to complete [this brief tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) to learn the basic syntax of the R programming language
